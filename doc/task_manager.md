# Task manager

The task manager I'm using is [`make`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). There are some reasons why `make` is the *goto* task manager to use:

- It is easy to use it, since the declaration of the rules is quite simple and easy to understand.
- I've used it in the past in other personal projects.
- It does not require any extra configuration file, just a Makefile.

There are other alternatives, like the ones below:

- [Gofer](https://github.com/chuckpreslar/gofer)
- [Gogradle](https://github.com/gogradle/gogradle), which is Gradle with a plugin for Go.
- [xmake](https://xmake.io/#/)
- [Cmake](https://cmake.org/)

Since `make` is more like a generic tool it can be also used for other tasks, not only related to the programming language ones. For example it can be used to generate documentation.
